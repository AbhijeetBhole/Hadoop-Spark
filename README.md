# Hadoop-Spark

##### This are POC's developed on HDFS using Hadoop and Spark. You will get feel of different technologies on top oh HDFS such as Sqoop, Hive, Pig. Also some POC's are developed using SPARK, which involves spark-api,spark-sql,spark-dataframes.

## POC1 using Hive

Algorithms
  1) Reading csv file in spark.
  2) Converting the RDD to dataframe.
  3) Analyzing the data set for :
    - Getting total amount of petrol in volume sold by every distributor.
    - top 10 distributors IDâ€™s for selling petrol and also display the amount of petrol sold in volume by them individually
    - 10 distributor name who sold petrol in the least amount.
  4) Storing the analyzed data back into HDFS also in HIVE for further analysis.
